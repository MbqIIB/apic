# Technical Workshop : API Connect

## Lab 5 : Analytics 

## Overview 


In this exercise, we will discover Analytics capabilities for both the API Provider and the API Consumer.

You'll better understand how scans are used to view information captured by the Gateway API. You can filter, sort, and aggregate your API event data; Next, present the results in correlated tables, tables, and maps to help you manage service levels, set quotas, set controls, set security policies, manage communities, and analyze trends.

Analytics API is based on the Kibana Open Source Analysis and Visualization Platform, which is designed to work with Elastic Search's real-time distributed search and analysis engine.


## Analytics : API Manager

The API Manager side analytics provides analysis information for the API Provider.

- Click on the icon **>>** -> **Dashboard** > **Sandbox**

- From the **Sandbox** Catalog configuration screen, click on the **Analysis** tab

- The default dashboard provides general information such as the five most active products and the five most active APIs. This information is interesting, but we can see other dashboards that provide more data.

- Click the `Load Saved Dashboards` icon to open the list of dashboards. Select the `api-default` dashboard.

- Here you will see interesting visualizations showing graphs and graphs containing information about processed API traffic.

- The analytical data can be filtered over different periods and the viewing areas can even be automatically updated. Click the calendar icon that specifies the default period of `Last 7 days`.

- Click on Application then on the application **mobileapp** (or another application of your choice) then click on the icon **Analyze**

- The consumer here has in real time its consumption of the APIs with the success rate, data usage, latency.
